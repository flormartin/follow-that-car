# Project FollowThatCar

The app is developed by students by the android pratical course from Institute of Automotive Technology, Technical University of Munich.

## Introduction

When you and your friend are going to a place, each in their own car, and your friend knows
the best route to that place, but you don‘t, it could come in handy to keep receiving the GPS
coordinates of your friend‘s car, map it to google maps and follow that route yourself.

## Features

Get the GPS coordinates from terminal A and store them somewhere. Terminal B should be
able to access these stored coordinates and create a route.

## Framework required

GoogleMaps, Firebase
